title: "Gren 24W: Streams, static executables and the compiler as a package"

A new version of the Gren programming language is now available. There are some changes in syntax, an option of compiling to a static executable, a rewrite of the Stream and String modules and parts of the compiler are now available in package form.

## What is this 24W thing?

June and December each year is when we do backward incompatible releases of the compiler and the core packages. Since each of these components have their own version
it hasn't been completely clear what to call a specific release.

From now on we'll refer to a set of packages based on when they were released. 24W, or the 2024 Winter release, consist of the following software:

* compiler v0.5.0
* gren-lang/core v6.0.0
* gren-lang/browser v5.0.0
* gren-lang/node v5.0.0

## Syntax changes

`case of` has now been renamed to `when is`. That means that code like this:

```gren
case String.toInt "42" of
  Just num ->
    "The string is a valid integer."

  Nothing ->
    "The string is _not_ a valid integer."
```

Must now be written as:

```gren
when String.toInt "42" is
  Just num ->
    "The string is a valid integer."

  Nothing ->
    "The string is _not_ a valid integer."
```

The rationale here is simply that `when is` reads better.

A change with bigger impact is that custom types are now limited to either 0 or 1 argument, where they previously could have many more.

Code like this is no longer valid:

```gren
type Person = Person String Int
```

If you want to associate multiple fields with a variant, you can use a record instead:

```gren
type Person = Person { name : String, age : Int }
```

The reasoning is the same that lead to the [removal of tuples](https://youtu.be/Sl9HHo1qDk0?si=wiJjSEMyl0f6HqTn). Positional arguments
leads to cryptic and brittle code where named arguments don't.

## Static executables

The rewrite of the compiler from Haskell to Gren continues with a slow but steady pace. In 24W the command line interface
of the compiler has rewritten in Gren. As we like to add new features while doing a rewrite, there's now a new command that gives you the
option of compiling a Gren program to a static executable.

If you compile a program with `make-static` a couple of interesting things will happen.

First, it will compile your program to a JavaScript bundle using the `--optimize` flag. This bundle will then be executed in the NodeJS
instance you're using to run the Gren compiler, stopping just shy of invoking the main function. The in-memory representation of your
program at this point will be saved to disk as a snapshot, and then injected into a copy of the NodeJS executable.

This copy is your static executable. When run it will start up faster, as much of the costs associated with initialization -- like parsing
the JavaScript, evaluating constants etc. -- has already been done when building the snapshot.

How much faster your static executable will run depends on the size of your program. We've seen anything from 10-25%.

Robin held a demo of this feature in [A Tour of Gren 24W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx-2jSbejI&t=1080s).

## Stream rewrite

In 24S there was a `Stream` module in `gren-lang/node`, but the only available streams where the standard input streams.

For 24W the `Stream` module has moved to `gren-lang/core`, meaning you can use streams no matter which platform you're targetting.

The module has also been completely rewritten, giving you the possibility of defining your own streams over arbitrary types, but also
giving you the option of piping data through multiple streams at once.

This new `Stream` implementation is based on Web Streams, which gives us access to some native stream transformations like compression/
decompression and converting between strings and bytes.

You can find more information in [the `Stream` module documentation](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/6.0.0/module/Stream).

## String rewrite

The `String` module has been rewritten so that all functions, unless otherwise noted, deal with code points as opposed
to character units. Code points is a variable sized representation of a unicode character, consisting of 1 or 2 character units.
This change makes it less likely that you'll unintentionally operate on half a character, at cost of performance for certain
operations.

On top of that, some functions have been introduce and some have been renamed, to be more in line with other modules like
`Array` and `Dict`.

## Misc. changes

* All functions named `filter` have been renamed to `keepIf`. Similarly, `filterMap` has been
renamed to `mapAndKeepJust` and `flatMap` to `mapAndFlatten`.
* Functions named `length` are expected to return in constant time. Where this isn't the case, the function
has been renamed to `count`.
* `Node.endWithCmd` has been replaced with `Node.endSimpleProgram`.
* The time-travelling debugger has been removed.
* The `ChildProcess` module has seen some incremental changes to fix a design mistake and to support `Stream`.
* Fixed a few sourcemapping bugs when compiling on a Windows system.
