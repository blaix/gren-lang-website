It wants to help you write correct software by being your assistant, pointing out likely mistakes as you write code. Finally, it tries to be available wherever you need it to be, so that you can use it to write CLI tools, backend- or even frontend applications.\\n\\nThere already exist a language that is close to matching this description: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). What Elm lacks is better support for Web API's, and official support for running outside the browser.\\n\\nWhile we could spend considerable time and effort in creating a language which would look very similar to Elm, we've instead decided to fork the compiler and core packages, and use that as the basis of Gren.\\n\\n### Differences from Elm\\n\\nIf you already know Elm, then you also know Gren. Even the core packages are similar. That said, there are some differences:\\n\\n* A git-based package manager. It's slower, but has access to any github repo that you have, even private ones.\\n* Extended support for pattern matching on records.\\n* The default sequential data structure is an immutable array, not a linked list.\\n* No tuples.\\n* No automatic constructors for type aliased records.\\n* No GLSL syntax.\\n* No reactor.\\n\\nIf you have no experience with Elm, you can read more about the language in our official [guide](/learn). If you'd like to try it out, you can find instructions on getting started [here](/install).\\n\\nVersion 0.1.0 is considered to be an alpha release. While you can write production quality software with it today, there are likely bugs in the compiler and core packages, and breaking changes are planned for the next release.\\n\\nIf you like what you see, consider joining the [community](/community). We can use all the help we can get.\\n\\n### Looking forward\\n\\nGren follows a six-month release cadence. The next release will be v0.2.0 and be made available in December.\\n\\nThe plan is to add support for more Web API's and basic support for applications running on the NodeJS runtime. In addition, the package manager will become more efficient and reliable.\\n\\n### Thank you, contributors\\n\\nThis release of Gren was made possible by people who've written new code, ported packages from Elm and provided valuable feedback on [Zulip](https://gren.zulipchat.com). Those people are, in alphabetic order:\\n\\n* Aaron VonderHaar\\n* Allan Clark\\n* Dimitri B.\\n* Gabriella Sartori\\n* Gaute Berge\\n* Harry Sarson\\n* Jeroen Engels\\n* Joaquin\\n* Julian Antonielli\\n* Lue\\n* Mario Rogic\\n* Oliver Sch\u00F6ning\\n* Ragnhild Aalvik\\n* Robin Heggelund Hansen\\n\\nThank you!\\n\"}","628379327":"[\"articles/220530_first_release.md\",\"articles/220822_documentation_as_a_first_class_citizen.md\",\"articles/221212_hello_nodejs.md\",\"articles/230315_testing_testing.md\",\"articles/230619_sourcemaps.md\"]","1828973924":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren 0.3.0: Source maps\",\"published\":\"2023-06-19\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nJavaScript developers have always had access to a powerful debugger for finding bugs in their applications. Since Gren compiles to JavaScript, it's also possible to use the same tool for debugging Gren applications. The experience isn't great, however, as you're forced to debug the JavaScript that the compiler spits out instead of the actual code you wrote.\\n\\nUntil today, that is.\\n\\nGren 0.3.0 is now released, and with it comes the option of outputting source maps.\\n\\nSource maps is a JSON data structure that the JavaScript runtime can read in order to understand the relation between the currently running code, and the source code it orignated from. When source maps are available, you can actually debug Gren code in the JavaScript debugger.\\n\\nAll you have to do is to pass the `--sourcemaps` flag to the compiler:\\n\\n```sh\\ngren make src/Main.gren --sourcemaps\\n```\\n\\nTo see how source maps improves Gren's debugging experience, you can watch [Robin's demo](https://youtu.be/Fly0y4lFgDc?t=515) of this feature on youtube.\\n\\n## What's next?\\n\\nWith the release of Gren 0.3, focus now turns to the 0.4 release in December. The main feature for that release will be Parametric Modules, which you can learn more about in this [Github issue](https://github.com/gren-lang/compiler/issues/81) or in this [video presentation](https://youtu.be/Fly0y4lFgDc?t=1099).\\n\\nThat's all for now. Head over to the [install page](/install) to get started.\\n\"}","1981034955":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren 0.2.1: Testing, testing\",\"published\":\"2023-03-15\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nThe original plan was to not do another release until Gren 0.3 this summer but, while this is still the goal, we've implemented enough functionality to warrant a new release today. The theme for Gren 0.3 is \\\"Testing and Debugging\\\", and Gren 0.2.1 delivers on the first half of this theme.\\n\\n## Local dependencies\\n\\nWith Gren 0.2 and earlier, you could only depend on packages which had a semver-formatted tag on github. For users of a package this works pretty well. For developers of a package, there isn't any easy way to test the package in a project _prior_ to publishing the tag.\\n\\nGren 0.2.1 adds support for local dependencies. Local dependencies are packages that reside on your local disk. Here's how you define a local dependency:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"application\\\",\\n  \\\"platform\\\": \\\"node\\\",\\n  \\\"source-directories\\\": [\\n    \\\"src\\\"\\n  ],\\n  \\\"gren-version\\\": \\\"0.2.1\\\",\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"direct\\\": {\\n      \\\"gren-lang/node\\\": \\\"1.2.0\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/core\\\": \\\"local:..\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/test\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/test-runner-node\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"indirect\\\": {\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe above `gren.json` is taken from the `test` folder of [gren-lang/core](https://github.com/gren-lang/core). As you can see, `gren-lang/core` is here defined as local dependency where the package is defined to reside in the parent folder.\\n\\nLocal dependencies has several limitations. The compiler will refuse to compile dependencies which themselves have local dependencies, and `gren package validate` will fail if a local dependency is defined./a\\nGren will also refuse to compile local dependencies which contain kernel code, that isn't also part of a git commit signed by Gren's lead developer.\\n\\n## An official test framework\\n\\nGren now has two packages allowing you to test your implementation. \\n\\n[gren-lang/test](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/test) is a port of [elm-exploration/test](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest), and is a package for defining tests.\\n\\n[gren-lang/test-runner-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/test-runner-node) allows you to define a Node.JS application that runs your defined tests.\\n\\nA minimal test program looks like the following:\\n\\n```gren\\nmodule Main exposing (main)\\n\\nimport Expect\\nimport Test exposing (Test, describe, test)\\nimport Test.Runner.Node exposing (Program, run)\\n\\nmain =\\n    run <|\\n        describe \\\"Tests\\\"\\n            [ test \\\"Always true\\\" <| \\\\_ ->\\n                Expect.pass\\n            ]\\n```\\n\\nTo run it, you need to do the following:\\n\\n```sh\\ngren compile src/Main.gren --output run_tests\\nnode run_tests\\n```\\n\\nIn order to write tests for your package, you can define a test application that imports your package as a local dependency.\\n\\nYou can see an example of this in [gren-lang/core](https://github.com/gren-lang/core/tree/e78cc321fc7521b87c0a60c04f5d911a9442db99/tests)'s test suite.\\n\\n## What's next\\n\\nThe next release will arrive this summer, and focus on code generation improvements for easier debugging and better performance. Hopefully, this release will also include support for generating source maps so that you can debug Gren code instead of the generated JavaScript.\\n\\nThat's it for now. Head over to the [install page](/install) to get started.\\n\"}","2384614171":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren 0.2: Hello, NodeJS\",\"published\":\"2022-12-12\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nSix months after the release of 0.1, a new release is here with a bunch of exciting features. This includes a built-in code formatter and basic support for creating applications that run on NodeJS.\\n\\n## Platforms\\n\\nWhen defining new projects, you now need to specify which platform you're targeting. There are three platforms to choose from: `common`, `browser` and `node`. The latter two decide where the application can run, wheras the `common` platform indicates that your code can run anywhere. In other words, packages targeting the `common` platform can be dependencies of either `browser` and `node` projects.\\n\\nIn practical terms, the platform setting decides which core packages you're allowed to depend on. If you're targeting the `browser` platform, you're _not_ allowed to depend on `gren-lang/node`, directly or indirectly. Likewise, a project targeting the `node` platform is forbidden from depending on `gren-lang/browser`. When targeting the `common` platform, you can depend on neither.\\n\\nIn order to make it easier to setup a project correctly, we've added two flags to the `gren init` command: `--package` and `--platform`. For instance, if you want to create a package project targeting the `node` platform, you can run:\\n\\n```sh\\ngren init --package --platform node\\n```\\n\\nIf you'd rather create a `node` application, then just leave out the `--package` flag.\\n\\nThe long-term goal is to support all built-in NodeJS API's, but currently we only support a small subset. To get a better idea of what's possible you can read the [gren-lang/node documentation](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node) or take a look at the [cat example program](https://github.com/gren-lang/example-projects/tree/main/cat).\\n\\nYou might also want to take a look at this [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGEOvIHDlBI) where Robin implements the unix echo program in Gren.\\n\\n## Formatting\\n\\nAaron VonderHaar, the author of `elm-format`, was working on a formatting tool for Gren before 0.1 was even released. With Gren 0.2, this tool is now ready to use.\\n\\nTo format your project, simply run `gren format`. To validate the formatting of a project, just run `gren format --validate`.\\n\\nWhile the formatter should work well enough for most projects, it's not finished. Bugs and less-than-stellar formatting is to be expected in some cases. If you come across any interesting behaviour, please let us know.\\n\\n## Package consolidation\\n\\nSeveral different packages have now been consolidated into fewer, but bigger packages. For example: `gren-lang/virtual-dom`, `gren-lang/html` and `gren-lang/svg` are now merged into `gren-lang/browser`.\\n\\nThe main reason for doing this has to do with project management. It's easier for me to deal with 5 bug trackers than 15, and it takes less time to migrate and publish 5 packages to Gren 0.2, instead of 15.\\n\\nAt the same time, there aren't really any downsides to developers. Fewer packages means less time being spent downloading packages, and since Gren has excellent dead-code elimination, your compiled output isn't getting bigger either.\\n\\nEverything hasn't been consolidated, though. `gren-lang/url`, `gren-lang/parser` and `gren-lang/web-storage` do still exist and will continue to do so until I'm certain that their API is stable enough to be consolidated into one of the \\\"big three\\\" packages.\\n\\nGoing forward, new functionality is likely to be introduced in standalone packages, then become merged into the right platform package when the API has stabilized.\\n\\n## Package management\\n\\nThe package manager has improved in almost every way.\\n\\nIt is now significantly faster, gives detailed error messages when you have incompatible dependencies in your project, and has learned a few new tricks to make it easier to manage your dependencies.\\n\\nThere's now a `gren package uninstall` command for removing a dependency from your project, as well as `gren package outdated` for seeing which dependencies are out of date.\\n\\n## New language features\\n\\nGren 0.2 also brings a few new language features. These don't radically change the language in any way, but provide small quality-of-life improvements.\\n\\n### Record update now works on any expression\\n\\nIn 0.1, record update syntax only worked on variable names, like this:\\n\\n```gren\\noriginalRecord = { value = \\\"original\\\" }\\n\\nupdatedRecord = { originalRecord | value = \\\"updated\\\" }\\n```\\n\\nHowever, any other expression isn't legal. So you can't do things like this:\\n\\n```gren\\nupdatedRecord = { OtherModule.originalRecord | value = \\\"updated\\\" }\\n```\\n\\nThis is one of the only places where we have such limitations. For instance, we don't limit what expressions you can have in `if` expressions or `case` expressions, or even inside literals. So it's confusing when a limitation like this exists.\\n\\nIn 0.2, you can now use record update syntax with _any_ expression. The above snippet will now compile, but so will much more complex expressions.\\n\\nThis change was contributed by Julian Antonielli.\\n\\n### Import aliases can now contain dots\\n\\nExactly what it says on the tin, the following import statement is now legal:\\n\\n```gren\\nimport Much.Nested.Module.Path as Nested.Path\\n```\\n\\n### Named unused constants\\n\\nWhen pattern matching or defining functions, you can use `_` to ignore a value. Here's an example:\\n\\n```gren\\nlength : Array a -> Int\\nlength array =\\n    Array.foldl (\\\\_ len -> len + 1) 0 array\\n```\\n\\nSometimes, it can be helpful to attach a name to the ignored value, as a reminder for what the value represents. In 0.2, you can do just that:\\n\\n```gren\\nlength : Array a -> Int\\nlength array =\\n    Array.foldl (\\\\_value len -> len + 1) 0 array\\n```\\n\\nNote: trying to use `_value` will trigger a compilation error.\\n\\nThis feature was contributed by Allan Clark.\\n\\n### Multi-line strings trims leading whitespace\\n\\nGren has dedicated syntax for defining a multi-line string. It looks like this:\\n\\n```gren\\nstr =\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    this\\n      is a\\n    string\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn 0.1, this is equivalent to\\n\\n```gren\\nstr = \\\"\\\\n    this\\\\n      is a\\\\n    string\\\\n\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn 0.2, multi-line strings trims away a common number of leading whitespace on each line, so that the multi-line string compiles to the equivalent of:\\n\\n```gren\\nstr = \\\"this\\\\n  is a\\\\nstring\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## What's next?\\n\\nThe 0.2 release is a big release, but we have no intention of stopping here. The 0.3 release will focus on testing & debugging, and will include features such as an official test framework, source maps for viewing Gren code in a JavaScript debugger and improved code generation.\\n\\nSince Gren will continue with its six-month release cadence, 0.3 is scheduled for release in June 2023.\\n\\nThat's it for now. Head over to the [install page](/install) to get started.\\n\"}","2885376689":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Documentation as a first class citizen\",\"published\":\"2022-08-22\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nA crucial aspect of any programming language, is how easy it is to discover and learn new functionality.\\n\\nOne of the most common questions asked since [Gren's first release](/news/220530_first_release) is \\\"what can I do with Gren?\\\" and \\\"where can I see what's in the core package? I don't have to read the code, do I?\\\".\\n\\nSearching through github and reading source code is far from the easiest way to discover and learn the finer details of a language, so today we're proud to announce the availability of [packages.gren-lang.org](https://packages.gren-lang.org). Here you can learn the documentation of Gren's core packages, and discover third-party packages as they arrive.\\n\\n### Discoverability\\n\\nThe packaging site provides full-text search to allow people to find a package by author, package name and keywords in the package summary. In addition, all recently updated packages are listed on the front page.\\n\\nIf you're a member of our [Zulip](https://gren.zulipchat.com), new package versions are posted to the `#packages` topic, so that you can discover new packages as they arrive.\\n\\n### Previewing documentation\\n\\nWhen you install the package site with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gren-packages) (`npm install -g gren-packages`), you get access to a binary called `gren-doc-preview` which will generate documentation for the package in your current directory, and host a local copy of the packaging site to display it. This let's you see exactly how the documentation will look when imported into the main packaging site, which helps you perfect your documentation with minimal effort.\\n\\n### Easy to self-host\\n\\nThe packaging site is easy to self-host. It runs on Node 16 and uses SQLite as its database. You can run it on your own machine in order to have access to documentation offline, or you can host it on a server to host the documentation for your private packages.\\n\\nJust like the Gren compiler, the packages site uses your local install of Git to retrieve packages from Github. As long as your git client has access to a Gren repo, the packages site can import it as well.\\n\\n### Future enhancements\\n\\nToday marks the first release, but it certaintly won't be the last. Several new features are planned for the future, like being able to mirror another package server, extensive caching and recursive imports of the dependencies of a package.\\n\\nWe believe that this new packaging site will enable new developers to discover new packages and learn how those packages work.\\n\\nAs always, if you've got some idea on how to improve it, we hope to discuss it further on our [Zulip](https://gren.zulipchat.com). See you there?\\n\"}"},"is404":false,"path":"news"}</script>
